This encompasses a range of functions, including the definition and compression of virtual orbital manifolds and density fitting for the calculation of electron-repulsion integrals (Coulomb vertex).\n\nFurthermore, PsiTK natively includes algorithms for MP2 and RPA calculations.","category":"section"}]
