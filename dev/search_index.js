This encompasses a range of functions, including the definition and compression of virtual orbital manifolds and density fitting for the calculation of electron-repulsion integrals (Coulomb vertex).\n\nFurthermore, PsiTK natively includes algorithms for MP2 and RPA calculations.","category":"section"},{"location":"#API-Reference","page":"Home","title":"API Reference","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#PsiTK.AbstractAlgoInfo","page":"Home","title":"PsiTK.AbstractAlgoInfo","text":"Abstract parent type for all algorithm states for callbacks.
